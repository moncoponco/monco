      <p class= "wood-text">I started making lamps during the pandemic, shaped by everything that was happening at the time— wildfires, protests, and so on . The more recent pieces, made while I was away from any real woodworking space, come from adapting objects that were either gifted by talented friends or simply found. Among them are the Cortazar chair and the Bird chair. These wood objects usually carry stories tied to a specific moment, almost as if they’re telling their own versions of things. They stand out against the clean, neutral objects you normally see at home, taking up their own contrastfull loudness. I’ve written down the stories behind a few of them, hoping to keep a record of the strange circumstances in which they came to be.</p>       <p class= "wood-text">The Cortazar chair was made by a man named Max. There is no hardware in the chair, its solid wood structure that has approximately three times my weight. Painted on it are the silhouettes of objects left at Cortazar's grave.</p> -->
